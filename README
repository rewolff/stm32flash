This was downloaded from sourceforge around june 10th 2016. 

Currently sourceforge is "down" which would make this project unavailable
for download... (I would've downloaded a fresh copy but can't). 

So... Here it is a copy of stm32flash. 

With stm32flash you can flash an STM32 that has been booted into 
"boot loader mode".  

All STM32 CPUs have "system memory" that contains a bootloader. 
The bootloader can load the flash over a serial connection for example
using this program. 

The bootloader often also supports I2C, SPI and USB  on cpus that 
have it.
